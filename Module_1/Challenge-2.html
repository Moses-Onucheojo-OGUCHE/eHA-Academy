        Nobody’s born <strong>smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t <em>talk</em>, can’t <em>walk</em>, certainly can’t do <em>algebra</em>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at <em>anything</em> at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t <em>count to 10.</em><br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his <em>ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each <em>wrong answer</em> making your brain a <em>little bit stronger.</em><br>
        <strong>Failing</strong> is just another word for <strong>growing</strong>. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the <em>most beautiful, complex concepts</em> in the <em>whole universe</em><br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn <strong>anything.</strong>
