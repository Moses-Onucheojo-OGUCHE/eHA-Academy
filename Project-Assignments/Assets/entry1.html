                <h3>Week 1: Intro to Web Development and Development Tools</h3>
                <p>In this week, I learned the basics of web design and development, how to use the eLearning Platform for the course, setting up the Development Environment and other necessary tools needed.</p>
                <p>I was able to download, install and set up  VSCode which serve as my development environment, set up my Git & GitHub account which is used for version control. I also set up a Slack account which serves as a means for communication.</p>
                <p>These platforms made my journey in web programming a lovely one, making everything very easy for me. VSCode made writing of my codes smooth and easy, tracking the different changes I made to my codes was handled well by Git & GitHub, while 
                    Slack helped in communicating with my mentor and fellow colleagues. It also served as ameans for to submit all my assignments.</p>
